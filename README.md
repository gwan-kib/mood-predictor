# HOW TO RUN LOCALLY
```
(type text following '-' into your terminal)

Make sure you have Python installed on your system first:
 - python --version
(if you do not, you'll have to download it from their website before proceeding) 

Ensure you have Flask and Flask-CORS installed:
- pip install flask flask-cors

Navigate to:
- cd path/to/mood-predictor/BackEnd

Run the Flask server:
 - python app.py

Should then see something like, '* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)', meaning the back-end is ready

Then open index.html and the website should run as described earlier
